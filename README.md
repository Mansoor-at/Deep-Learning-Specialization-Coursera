# Deep Learning Specialization-Coursera

This Repo contains my solutions to Deep Learning Specialization courses on Coursera by Andrew Ng. 
This is just for learning purpose and knowledge sharing. Every one should try to solve prograaming assignments on their own to value the coursera honor code, but if anyone is stuck on some small problem, they may refer this repo. 


# First Course: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Assignment solutions for Week 2, 3, 4 are uploaded on this repo. 
Week1: Introduction to Deep Learning
Week 2: Neural Network Basics
Week 3: Shallow Neural Networks
Week 4: Deep Neural Networks

# Second Course: NImproving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
Coming soon....
